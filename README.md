# DOS-Console-Game

This code is the backend logic for a small role-playing game (RPG) management system using Java. 

This is not a graphical game. 

It is the game engine logic that manages characters, quests, and outcomes.

The program will allow a user to:

- Recruit heroes
- Manage a party
- Send heroes on quests
- Resolve quest outcomes
- Track stats and reports
